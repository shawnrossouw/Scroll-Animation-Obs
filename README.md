# Scroll animation using the intersection observer.

### This is an alternative to using scroll magic with vanilla Js and the ISO Api.

#### Instructions

Add a .animates class on the DOM element you wish the intersection observer should observe. Style a .show class in the root of the element style which has the animates class. Javascript will add the .show class as soon as the intersection observer intersects with the DOM element which has the animates class. Apply opposite styles on the base element as to what must happen in the .show class.
